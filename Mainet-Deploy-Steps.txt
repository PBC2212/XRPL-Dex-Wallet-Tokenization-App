ðŸš€ Mainnet Deployment Steps
Here's your step-by-step production deployment process:
Phase 1: Pre-Production Preparation
1. Environment Configuration
E:\XRPL-Dex-Wallet-Tokenization-App\server
notepad .env
Add/Update:
envNODE_ENV=production
XRPL_NETWORK=MAINNET
XRPL_MAINNET_URL=wss://xrplcluster.com
API_PORT=3001
2. Security Audit

 Code review completed
 All test transactions successful on testnet
 Security vulnerabilities patched
 Private keys properly secured
 API endpoints secured with authentication

Phase 2: Mainnet Wallet Setup
1. Create Production Wallets
bashcd E:\XRPL-Dex-Wallet-Tokenization-App\cli
node xrpl-cli.js wallet:create --name "Production Issuer Wallet"
2. Fund Production Wallets

Purchase XRP from licensed exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
Send minimum 15-20 XRP to your issuer wallet for:

Account activation (10 XRP reserve)
Transaction fees
Token operations



Phase 3: Network Switch
1. Update Server Environment
bash# In server directory
set NODE_ENV=production
set XRPL_NETWORK=MAINNET
npm start
2. Verify Mainnet Connection
bashcd E:\XRPL-Dex-Wallet-Tokenization-App\cli
node xrpl-cli.js health
Should show: "Network: MAINNET"
Phase 4: Production Testing
1. Test Small Token Creation
bashnode xrpl-cli.js token:create --name "Test Production Token" --code "TEST" --supply 100
2. Verify on XRPL Explorer

Visit: https://livenet.xrpl.org/
Search your wallet address
Confirm token appears on mainnet

Phase 5: Legal & Compliance
Before major deployments:

 Legal review of tokenization structure
 Regulatory compliance check
 Terms of service for investors
 KYC/AML procedures if required
 Insurance considerations

Phase 6: Production Operations
1. Create Real Asset Tokens
bashnode xrpl-cli.js token:create \
  --name "123 Main Street Property" \
  --code "MAIN123" \
  --supply 1000000 \
  --description "Commercial property tokenization"
2. Monitor Operations
bashnode xrpl-cli.js network:status
node xrpl-cli.js token:list
Phase 7: Investor Onboarding
For each investor:

They create XRPL wallet (via your CLI or XUMM wallet)
They fund wallet with XRP for activation
Create trustline to your token:

bashnode xrpl-cli.js invest:trustline --currency MAIN123 --issuer YOUR_ADDRESS

Purchase tokens via payment transactions

ðŸš¨ Critical Mainnet Warnings:
1. Real Money: All XRP transactions use real money
 2. Irreversible: Mainnet transactions cannot be undone
 3. Regulations: Comply with securities laws in your jurisdiction
 4. Backup: Secure backup of all wallet seeds/private keys
 5. Insurance: Consider professional liability insurance
ðŸ“‹ Pre-Mainnet Checklist:

 All testnet testing completed successfully
 Legal compliance review done
 Production wallets funded with XRP
 Team trained on mainnet procedures
 Backup and recovery procedures tested
 Incident response plan ready
 Customer support processes established

ðŸ”’ Security for Mainnet:
1. Hot/Cold Wallet Strategy:

Hot Wallet: Small amounts for daily operations
Cold Wallet: Bulk funds stored offline

2. Multi-signature setup:

Consider multi-sig wallets for large amounts
Require multiple team members to authorize large transactions

3. Monitoring:

Set up alerts for all wallet transactions
Daily balance reconciliation
Real-time monitoring of token issuance

ðŸ’¡ Recommended Mainnet Workflow:
Start Small:

Deploy one small test token first
Verify everything works correctly
Gradually scale up operations
Monitor and optimize

Are you ready to switch to mainnet, or do you want to do more testnet testing first?
