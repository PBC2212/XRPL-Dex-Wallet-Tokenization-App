Prompt for Lovable AI

Build a professional investor information portal for a Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization business that integrates with our existing backend XRPL system. The Lovable site is frontend-only and acts as an informational and onboarding hub for investors.

Key Goals:

Clearly explain our RWA tokenization business model, benefits, and how investors can participate.

Present compliance, legal, and risk disclosure information in a professional layout.

Provide an “Initiate Tokenization” call-to-action button that links to our backend application hosted at:
https://your-digitalocean-app-link.com

The backend (already deployed) handles wallet creation, XRPL tokenization, and trustline setup — so Lovable AI should not attempt to implement blockchain features itself. Instead, the frontend should seamlessly direct users to the backend when they are ready to start.

Page Structure:

Hero Section:

Headline: “Invest in the Future of Real-World Asset Tokenization”

Subheading explaining our XRPL-based platform and investor opportunities.

Large “Start Tokenization” button (links to backend app).

About the Platform:

Explain XRPL integration, tokenization process, and benefits (e.g., speed, transparency, liquidity).

Investor Benefits:

Bullet points on earning potential, fractional ownership, liquidity access, and secure blockchain settlement.

How It Works:

Step-by-step infographic:

Review investment opportunities

Complete KYC on backend

Tokenize assets & add trustlines

Receive asset-backed tokens

Security & Compliance:

Explain KYC/AML, asset custody, and compliance measures.

Legal Disclaimers:

Risk disclosure, investment disclaimers, and jurisdictional notices.

Contact Form:

Name, email, and message fields with secure form submission.

Design Requirements:

Modern, clean UI with investor-friendly branding.

Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Include trust-building visuals: asset imagery, blockchain graphics, investor-focused icons.

Ensure “Start Tokenization” button is visible on desktop and mobile, always linking to backend.

Special Instructions:

Do not implement XRPL wallet creation, tokenization, or trustlines in Lovable.

Focus on investor engagement, clarity, and smooth redirection to backend for actual transactions.

Treat this as a production-ready, public-facing website that passes compliance checks for a blockchain investment information portal.
