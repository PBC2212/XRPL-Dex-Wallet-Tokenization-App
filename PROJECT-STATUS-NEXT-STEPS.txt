🏠 REAL ESTATE DEMO SCENARIO
The complete demo demonstrates tokenizing a $800,000 Miami Beach condominium:

Property: 123 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach, FL
Token: MIA (Miami Beach Condo Token)
Supply: 1,000,000 tokens ($0.80 per token)
Workflow:

Property owner creates token with metadata
Investor buys 300,000 tokens (30% ownership = $240K)
Secondary market: Investor sells 100,000 tokens to buyer ($85K)
Final ownership: 20% investor, 10% buyer, 70% owner




🌐 NETWORK CONFIGURATION

Current: XRPL Testnet (safe for testing)
Testnet URL: wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233
Mainnet Ready: Change XRPL_NETWORK=MAINNET in .env
Test XRP Faucet: https://xrpl.org/xrpl-testnet-faucet.html


🎯 NEXT STEPS - FRONTEND INTEGRATION
The backend is 100% ready for frontend integration. Here's what to build next:
IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. REST API Server (Priority 1)
Create server/api-server.js with Express.js:

POST /api/wallets - Generate/import wallets
POST /api/tokens - Create tokens
POST /api/trustlines - Manage trustlines
GET /api/balances/:address - Get balances
WebSocket support for real-time updates

2. React Dashboard (Priority 2)
Build admin interface with:

Wallet Management - Create, import, backup wallets
Asset Tokenization - Upload property docs, create tokens
Investor Portal - Browse assets, create trustlines, invest
Portfolio View - Track ownership percentages
Transaction History - Monitor all operations

3. Mobile App (Priority 3)
React Native app for:

Mobile Wallet - QR scanning, payments
Investment Marketplace - Browse tokenized assets
Portfolio Tracking - Real-time balance updates

FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE OPTIONS:

Next.js Full-Stack (Recommended)

API routes for backend integration
Server-side rendering for SEO
Built-in optimizations


React SPA + Express API

Separate frontend/backend
Scalable microservices
Easy deployment


React Native Mobile

Cross-platform mobile app
QR code integration
Push notifications
