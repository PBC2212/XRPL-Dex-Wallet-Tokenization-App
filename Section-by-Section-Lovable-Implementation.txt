Lovable AI Prompt

Build a modern investor information portal for a Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization business that integrates visually with our XRPL-based backend but handles only the frontend.

Sleek, clean, and professional for a blockchain investment audience

High-conversion design with a prominent “Start Tokenization” button linking to https://your-digitalocean-app-link.com

Responsive on desktop and mobile

Use blockchain, asset, and trust-themed visuals

Ensure all language is compliance-safe and informational only
